# Data Structures and Algorithms in C Language

Welcome to the **C DSA** repository! This collection showcases implementations of various data structures and algorithms written in C. It serves as a resource for learners, developers, and enthusiasts who want to explore DSA concepts and their practical applications in C programming.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following categories, each containing relevant implementations:

- **Arrays**: Operations and algorithms related to arrays.  
- **Graphs**: Algorithms like BFS, DFS, and graph traversal techniques.  
- **Linked List**: Implementations of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.  
- **Queues**: Queue data structures, including circular and priority queues.  
- **Trees**: Binary trees, AVL trees, and traversal algorithms.  
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, linear search, and other searching techniques.  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Merge sort, quicksort, bubble sort, and more.  

Each folder contains the relevant C files implementing the data structures and algorithms.

## Note on File Naming

The files in this repository are named with a numbering system, such as `25_Merge_Sort.c` and `31_Depth_First_Search.c`. This numbering reflects the sequence in which I studied and implemented these concepts. If you are new to DSA, this numbering may provide a helpful learning order‚Äîbut feel free to explore them in any sequence!

Explore the folders to find the implementations you are interested in. Each folder contains a README.md file explaining the algorithms or data structures in detail.

## How to Run the Programs

### Prerequisites
You need a C compiler to run the programs. Popular options include:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)  
- Turbo C++  
- Online IDEs like [replit](https://replit.com/) or [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/).

### Compilation and Execution
To compile and execute a C program:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the desired `.c` file.
2. Use the following commands:
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o output
   ./output
   ```
